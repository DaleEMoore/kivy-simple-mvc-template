TODO
Oh that's right, I remember now - this project kivy-simple-mvc-template does lots of stuff in an
arabic (I think) language. I don't see data being changed here. Perhaps I just don't know how to
drive the program...
    Spend some time learning how to drive kivy-simple-mvc-template.
    Evalute kivy-simple-mvc-template for MVC use.


Figure out what I need to do for MVC, or other;
    DB CRUD for intRep.
